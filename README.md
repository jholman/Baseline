= Baseline =

This is the home of the Baseline, a cutting-edge new language in a cutting-edge new paradigm, Deque-Based Programming.  It's the natural and yet revolutionary extension of stack-based programming, itself enjoying widespread success in FORTH, Factor, PostScript, and the JVM.

Baseline is still in an underdocumented prototype phase, but it's successfully running Hello World.  From the project directory, try this:

'''
$ bin/baseline samples/hw.bl
Hello, world!
$
'''

(requires Python, tested with Python 2.6 and 2.7)
