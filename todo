Tasks:
[ ] finish the stdlib
[ ] catch up the unit testing
    [ ] unit-test entire stdlib
[ ] write some better samples
    [ ] 1-40 fizzbuzz ?
    [ ] sieve of eratosthenes ?
[ ] documentation
[ ] improve README
[ ] packaging?
[ ] additional data types
    [ ] floating-point literals
    [ ] maybe non-decimal literals?     ⁰ˣ⁴ᵇᶜ³ ₀ₓ₁ₐ₂    subscript is missing {bcdf} though...
    [ ] maybe scientific-notation literals?         
    [ ] convert I/O to UTF-8 (incl stop using chr())
[ ] coding utilities
    [ ] string converter
    [ ] vim plugin for program entry


Note:
* my function nametable doesn't allow mixed baseline/python implementations, which was a goal
