Tasks:
[✓] fundef tokenizer (rewrite existing one)
[✓] fundef parser
[ ] write super-retarded interpreter stub:
    [✓] initialize all data zones
        [ ] note: rstack format:
            [ ] your return location is a pair: fn-id, instruction-index
            [ ] these are pushed onto the rstack as two elements
            [ ] the inidx goes on first, then then fnid
            [ ] inidx is negative if we're in inverse mode
    [ ] on program termination, spits out existing dstack, as a temporary measure
    [ ] read in function definitions into dictionary
    [ ] make 0 the default main
[ ] implement literal-push
[ ] implement some core functions
    [ ] pop, clone, split, merge, move-to-bottom
    [ ] the arithmetic functions
    [ ] flowcontrol: call, if-then, 
[ ] implement function calls from functions
[ ] flesh out the stdlib









What commands get what function-ids?

stack commands
     1      pop
     2      clone
     3      move-to-bottom
     5      split
*    6      split-reverse
     7      merge
     8      swap-with-rstack
    
extra stack commands
*   11      pop-n
*   12      close-n
*   13      move-to-bottom-n
    
pipes
    21      produce
    22      consume
    23      open file
    24      open unix socket

    27      send UDP datagram
    29      sys.exit                    takes one int if avail, defaults to 0
    
flowcontrol
    31      call (unconditional)
    32      recurse call (to self)
